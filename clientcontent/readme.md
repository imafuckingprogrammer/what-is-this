About
Headline:
Built in Abu Dhabi. Wired for what’s next.
Subheadline:
We’re not another agency chasing trends,we’re the ones shaping what people
remember.

The Problem We Saw
Too many brands were stuck in the same loop: flashy visuals, no real strategy, and
disappointing results.
And too many “agencies” were just designers with no marketing backbone, selling surface
when what brands needed was substance.
We started TrendArt to be the agency we couldn’t find:
one that blends clarity and creativity, thinks in strategy and storytelling, and treats every
brand like it actually matters.

What We Do (in plain words)
We help brands cut through the noise and make things people care about, with strategy,
design, content, and marketing that’s clear, intentional, and built to perform.
Whether you’re a startup, a clinic, a restaurant, or a B2B brand trying to scale, we build the tools
that make your brand easier to understand, easier to love, and harder to ignore.

What Makes Us Different
● We actually know marketing — not just design.
● We lead with clarity — so you’re never guessing what we’re doing or why.
● We stay small on purpose — so you always work with people who care.

● We think regionally — built in the UAE, shaped by the culture around us.

How We Work
These are the principles that shape every project we take on, not just what we believe,
but how we help you win.

Strategic Thinking
You’re not hiring us to guess. Every move we make is grounded in strategy, so your brand
doesn’t just look good, it’s built to work.

Collaborative Partnership
We don’t disappear into a process. You’ll always know what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and
how it connects to your goals.

Relentless Craft
Your audience notices the details, so do we. From the first moodboard to the final asset, we
obsess over getting it right.

Measured Impact
This isn’t about “nice to have” content. We track what works, learn what doesn’t, and focus on
what actually drives results.

Authentic Innovation

We explore bold ideas, without losing who you are. Creativity should amplify your brand, not
distract from it.

Built-In Focus (replaces “we stay small on purpose”)
You work directly with people who know the work. No fluff, no hand-offs, no lost context, just
clear thinking and sharp execution.

Long-Term Vision
Trends fade. We help you build a brand that lasts, with systems, stories, and strategy that still
make sense tomorrow.

You can add a small clean grid of team members or a line like:
We’re a small team of strategists, designers, and storytellers, big on thinking, light
on ego.

What It’s Like to Work With Us
No confusion. No inflated decks. No disappearing after the contract is signed.
We keep it simple: understand your brand → build the right things → deliver results.
That’s it.

Headline:
Everything you need. Nothing you don’t.
Subheadline:
We build brands with intention — from strategy to launch and beyond.

1. Brand Strategy & Identity
Make your brand make sense.
Before people buy into your product, they buy into your story. We help you get the message
right, and make it stick.
What’s included:
● Brand positioning & voice
● Messaging strategy
● Visual identity (logos, color, typography)
● Brand guidelines

Learn More
A strong brand isn’t just a logo, it’s how people feel when they see, hear, or interact with you.
We help you find your voice, clarify your story, and shape a brand that’s built to last.
Here’s what we do:
● Positioning: We define where your brand stands in the market and why people should
care.
● Messaging: We write the words that make people get it, and remember it.
● Tone of Voice: From captions to campaigns, we help your brand sound like itself.

● Visual Identity: Logos, color palettes, typography, and guidelines, crafted to reflect who
you are, not just what's trendy.

Why it matters:
If your brand feels unclear, inconsistent, or forgettable, strategy fixes that. This is the foundation
everything else is built on.

2. Web & Digital
Your digital presence, designed to perform.
Your website is often your first impression. We make sure it’s not your last.
What we build:
● Custom websites (static, e-commerce, mobile-first)
● Mobile app development
● SEO optimization
● Performance & speed tuning
● Ongoing support and hosting (optional)
Learn More
Your website is more than a portfolio. It’s your digital home, your sales tool, and your first
impression. We design and develop with all of that in mind, clean UX, responsive design, and
performance that keeps people around.
What we offer:
● Static & E-commerce Sites: Fast, beautiful, and mobile-ready, with clean interfaces
and smart flows.
● App Development: User-focused mobile apps, built custom from the ground up.
● Performance Optimization: Speed, SEO, and mobile responsiveness, so your site
ranks and loads right.

● Ongoing Support (Optional): Hosting, updates, and analytics dashboards tailored to
your needs.

Why it matters:
A pretty site means nothing if it’s slow, clunky, or confusing. We design to convert, not just to
impress.

3. Content & Production
Scroll-stopping content, built for your brand.
We create content that feels good, looks good, and performs even better.
What we produce:
● Reels, short-form, and before/after edits
● Product and brand photography
● High-end ad campaigns (video, scripting, editing)
Learn More
The scroll is ruthless, if your content doesn’t stop someone, it gets skipped. We create with
intention: content that catches attention, tells your story, and drives action.
We produce:
● Reels & Short-form Video: Scripted or organic, edited to match your tone and goals.
● Photography: From lifestyle to product, we handle lighting, styling, and retouching.
● Before & After Edits: Perfect for transformation-based businesses (cosmetics, beauty,
fitness, etc.).
● High-End Ads: Cinematic visuals, full production, storyboarding, scripting, editing.

Why it matters:
Good content builds trust. Great content builds momentum. We make sure your brand looks its
best, and performs at its best.

4. Marketing & Growth
Strategy that scales. Execution that delivers.
Design is just the beginning, we help you reach the right people, in the right way, at the right
time.
What we handle:
● Digital marketing campaigns
● Social media management
● Paid ads (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.)
● Funnel planning & performance tracking
● Analytics dashboards (optional)

Learn More
Your audience won’t just show up. We help you find them, speak to them, and guide them
through a journey, from awareness to conversion.
Our approach:
● Digital Campaigns: Strategy-led ads across Meta, Google, TikTok, and more.
● Social Media Management: Planning, posting, captioning, and calendar building —
tailored to your audience.
● Funnel Planning: Build out customer paths that drive action and revenue.
● Analytics & Optimization: Ongoing performance checks, tracking tools, and clarity on
what’s working (or not).

Why it matters:
Marketing without strategy is guesswork. We bring clarity, consistency, and results, so every
move has a reason.

5. Consulting & Training
Want to build in-house? We’ve got you.
We help internal teams level up, with clear frameworks, hands-on guidance, and real marketing
skills.
Services include:
● One-on-one consulting
● In-house team training
● Strategic audits & planning

Learn More
If you’re building an in-house team or just need sharper direction, we can guide the way. From
audits to custom workshops, we share the same thinking we use in our own work, and tailor it to
yours.
What we offer:
● 1:1 Consulting: Strategy sessions for founders, CMOs, or anyone shaping the brand.
● In-house Team Training: We train your team to think like marketers, not just post like
them.
● Brand & Content Audits: Honest, thorough reviews with actionable insights.

Why it matters:
Sometimes you don’t need an agency forever, you just need one that helps you grow smarter.
We’re that team.

turn relationships into real growth.
Services include:
● LinkedIn Strategy & Management
● Referral Program Campaigns
● Thought Leadership Content
● Lead Magnet & Funnel Setup

Learn More
B2B isn’t about going viral, it’s about building trust, showing value, and staying top-of-mind. We
help you do that with the right content, on the right platforms, for the right people.
What we offer:
● LinkedIn Strategy & Management: From content to engagement, we help you grow a
presence that earns respect, not just likes.

promoters.

checklists, landing pages, and more.

Why it matters:
B2B buyers move slower, think deeper, and expect more. We help you show up like a brand
they can trust, with content that leads to real conversations.
